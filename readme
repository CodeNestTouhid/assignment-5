1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

ans:


getElementById => By getElementById, we can access a single element that has a specific id.

getElementsByClassName => By getElementsByClassName, we can access all elements that have a specific class name.

querySelector => By querySelector, we can access the first element that matches a specific css selector.

querySelectorAll =>  By querySelectorAll, we can access all the elements that match a specific css selector.


2. How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?

ans:
 document.createElement() method to create an element and appendChild() to add on parent element .




3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?

ans: Event bubbling is a move through the HTML structure. When clicked on an element, the event doesn't just happen on that element and Thats events are handled in JavaScript.



4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

ans:Event delegation is a clever technique that uses event bubbling to my advantage.
It useful cause less memory,flexibility etc.



5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?

ans:
preventDefault() => This stops the browser's default behavior.
stopPropagation() => This stops the event from bubbling up.It's like chain reaction on up the DOM tree.
